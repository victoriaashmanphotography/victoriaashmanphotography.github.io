In July, we went to North Wales for a landscape photography trip. The trip was important to me for many reasons. I went to Bangor University, and I loved my time up there, really feeling like I had found my home. I had not been back to Bangor for ten years due to ill-health - so a trip was long overdue. North Wales has the most beautiful landscapes, so it is a must for landscape photographers.</description></item><item><title>Arcangel Creative Stock Photography</title><link>https://victoriaashmanphotography.github.io/posts/arcangel/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victoriaashmanphotography.github.io/posts/arcangel/</guid><description>I have recently signed a three-year contract to join Arcangel, a creative stock photography agency. I’m mainly interested in producing photographs that will end up on book covers, and I hope that this is a fruitful endeavour.
But, goodness has it been challenging. I have submitted 42 pictures so far and only 12 have been accepted. Rejection is difficult, but as it turns out is quite common at Arcangel. They have a high rejection rate (as they only accept the best imagery to keep their image library strong), which is no bad thing for the photographer and the industry.</description></item><item><title>Archaeological sites in the local area</title><link>https://victoriaashmanphotography.github.io/posts/archaeological/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victoriaashmanphotography.github.io/posts/archaeological/</guid><description>I am nine months post-transplant. I would love to say that it’s been an easy ride, that I instantly felt amazing. Well, actually I did, but I think this had a lot to do with the initial high dose of steroids, the incredible high at being alive and the instant easing of the strain of kidney failure. As steroids were weaned down (to my maintenance dose), I started to struggle – there was a realisation that this would not be a smooth ride.</description></item><item><title>Creative imagery at Arcangel</title><link>https://victoriaashmanphotography.github.io/posts/featured3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victoriaashmanphotography.github.io/posts/featured3/</guid><description>I recently signed a 3 year contract with Arcangel.

It’s been both an amazing time, and at points very difficult – due to the horrible word rejection and a near hospital readmission. It has been beyond what I could have possibly imagined. It’s also been quite lonely. I’ve been shielding and so my normal support network (apart from Darren), have not been able to help me like they would have done.</description></item><item><title>Oh Life</title><link>https://victoriaashmanphotography.github.io/posts/oh-life/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victoriaashmanphotography.github.io/posts/oh-life/</guid><description>So, I thought I’d should give a progress report. I am better, but life is still challenging and unfortunately for me it’s painful the majority of the time.
I thought the best way to show you a glimpse into my life would be to write about a typical day. I wake up at 7.30, have breakfast and then get onto dialysis just before 8. When its not painful I can be off dialysis and clearing up at about 8.</description></item><item><title>There and back again</title><link>https://victoriaashmanphotography.github.io/posts/there-and-back-again/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victoriaashmanphotography.github.io/posts/there-and-back-again/</guid><description>There and back again
So my last post was a bit traumatic. I wrote it, I lived it and I never want to revisit it. A few months on and I am much stronger. Life is still challenging as I am doing dialysis four times a day and sometimes its painful, sometimes its gruelling and sometimes its just over with no fuss. Fortunately there is a bit of light in sight.</description></item></channel></rss>
