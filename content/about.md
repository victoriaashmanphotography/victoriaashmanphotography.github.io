Hi, thank you for taking the time to read about me and visit my website, my name is Victoria.

My love of photography started after I became unwell. This changed my attitude in many ways but really it taught me to see the beauty around me. I was at Bangor university at the time – on the doorstep of Snowdonia and this combined with the nature of my studies gave me a real appreciation for my surroundings, and so developed my first love… landscape photography.

Leaving university with a passion for photography, I started photographing weddings in 2008 and eventually took on a tiny studio. It was then that I started children and baby photography… and I loved it! I progressed to a larger studio, I became a cherubs photographer accredited by the MPA and then I went out completely on my own.

I needed so much patience studying archaeology, (it is never a fast process!) & I feel this skill was transferred to working with babies and children, where you also need an abundance of patience. I closed my studio in 2018, due to ill health, but continued with stock photography. In 2020 I had a transplant and have been building my photography business slowly. I got accepted to Arcangel images, a photographic agency that specialises in book covers and this is where I am focussing my energy, but I am also getting back to landscape photography, my first love.

Thank you for your time, Victoria x
